CloudSwipe is a WordPress e-commerce plugin that lets you sell digital and physical products with a strong focus on security and PCI compliance.

== Description ==

CloudSwipe will turn any WordPress site, using any theme into a full featured, secure e-commerce store. One of the largest hurdles to overcome when launching an e-commerce site is handling the security. You need to accept credit card payments but it is very complicated and expensive to make sure your site is secure and PCI compliant. It is not enough to simply install an SSL certificate or get a security scan. There are many other [requirements for PCI compliance](http://blog.cloudswipe.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-pci-compliance/ "PCI Compliance").
